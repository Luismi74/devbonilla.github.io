# My Portfolio (luismi74.github.io)

This is the source code for my developer portfolio, feel free to check it out.

**Important note** is that the mobile version works perfectly on my Oneplus 7T using Chrome or Duckduckgo browser, but when tested on an iPhone had some alignment issues which I will be focusing to fix soon.

### I've couldn't make it without these great resources:

* This helped me create the I'm A section: https://codepen.io/EricPorter/pen/JjPmOOb
